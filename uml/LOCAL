The FireBox and Twisted subsystem can be run without a UML.

Create a symbolic link /var/www/scraperwiki to the top directory.
This is needed as the installation path is written into a lot of places.
For instance on my machine (as root):

ln -s /home/mike/ScraperWiki/scraperwiki /var/www/scraperwiki

Create the following symlinks

( cd dispatcher	 ; ln -s ../swlogger/swlogger.py dispatcher/swlogger.py  ) 
( cd firestarter ; ln -s ../swlogger/swlogger.py firestarter/swlogger.py ) 
( cd ftpproxy	 ; ln -s ../swlogger/swlogger.py ftpproxy/swlogger.py	 ) 
( cd httpproxy	 ; ln -s ../swlogger/swlogger.py httpproxy/swlogger.py	 ) 

Edit settings.py in your web subdirectory to have:

ORBETED_PORT = 8001
ORBETED_DOMAIN = 'localhost:8001'

Create a mysql database called "scraperwiki_log" and grant access to user
"scraperlog" with password "scr4p3rl0g"; best bet is to grant access from 
everywhere and anywhere, ie:

create database scraperwiki_log ;
grant all on scraperwiki_log.* to 'scraperlog'@'localhost' identified by 'scr4p3rl0g' ;
grant all on scraperwiki_log.* to 'scraperlog'@'%' identified by 'scr4p3rl0g' ;

You should now be able to run the pretend UML system:

To start (or restart)	:	./runlocal
To stop			:	./killlocal

These scripts start (restart) or stop using the scripts in ./etc/local.d; these
are stand-alone analogues of the init.d scripts. Process identifiers will be
written to files in ./var/run; log files will appeara in ./var/log

When started, services should be running for

	orbited
	twisted
	dispatcher
	controller
	httpproxy
	ftpproxy
	dataproxy

Run django as normal.
