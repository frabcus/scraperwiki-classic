How to start the backend locally:

Create a symbolic link /var/www/scraperwiki to the top directory.
This is needed as the installation path is written into a lot of places.
For instance on my machine (as root):

ln -s /home/mike/ScraperWiki/scraperwiki /var/www/scraperwiki

To start :	./runlocal
To stop	 :	./hardkilllocal.py

These scripts start (restart) or stop using the scripts in ./etc/local.d; these
are stand-alone analogues of the init.d scripts. Process identifiers will be
written to files in ./var/run; log files will appeara in ./var/log
