The FireBox and Twisted subsystem can be run without a UML by running the
command:

./runlocal

This will run the Dispatcher, the Proxy, the Controller and the orbited and
twisted servers on the host system, such that they will function as run with a
UML except that there will be no fireboxing.

This should be all that's needed to run code in the editor.

The orbited daemon will listen on port 8001, you need to not be using that port
for anything else.

DEBUGGING:

* If things go wrong look for exceptions in the various UML/log directories.

* You can run the runner by itself. In UML/Server/scripts run "Runner.py".
Then type in a short Python program (e.g. "print 1") on the command line,
and press Ctrl+D. You will get an error, or the output of the short
Python program in a structure.

To stop the processes:

./killlocal
