<h2>What is ScraperWiki?</h2>
	
		<p>There's lots of useful data on the internet - crime
		statistics, government spending, 
			<a href="http://www.nationalpetregister.org/">missing kittens</a>...</p>

		<p>But getting at it isn't always easy. There's a table here, a report
		there, web pages, PDFs, spreadsheets... And it can be scattered over
		thousands of different places on the web, making it hard to see the whole
		picture and the story behind it.</p>

		<p>It's like trying to build something from Lego when someone has
		hidden the bricks all over town and you have to find them before
		you can start building!</p>

		<p>To get at data, programmers write bits of code called 'screen
		scrapers', which extract the useful bits so they can be reused in other apps, or
		rummaged through by journalists and researchers.</p>
		
		<p>But these bits of code
		tend to break,  get thrown away or forgotten once they have been
		used, and so the data is lost again. Which is bad.</p>

		<p>ScraperWiki is an online tool to make that process simpler and more
		collaborative. Anyone can write a screen scraper using the online
		editor, and the code and data are shared with the world.</p>
		
		<p>Because it's a wiki, other programmers can
		contribute to and improve the code. And, if you're not a programmer
		yourself, you can <a href="{% url market_solicitation %}">request a scraper</a> or ask the
		ScraperWiki team to <a href="{% url contact_form %}">write one for you</a>.</p>
		
<h2>People</h2>

				<p>The original idea for ScraperWiki was Julian Todd's. Developers Richard Pope, Sym Roe, Anna Powell-Smith and Mike Richardson helped to build it.</p> 
				
				<p>Aidan McGuire and Aine McGuire managed it all, and our mentors were Francis Irving and Tom Steinberg. Thanks also to Francis Davey for the legal advice.</p>

				<h2>Code</h2>

				<p>ScraperWiki is built in Django and is available under the Affero GPL open source licence. You can find the code (in Mercurial) <a href="https://kforgehosting.com/project/scraperwiki/">here</a>.</p>

				<h2>Funding</h2>

				<p>ScraperWiki was created with support from <a href="http://www.4ip.org.uk/">4iP</a>, Channel 4's web development fund.</p>

		        <h2>Logos</h2>
		        <p>The icons we use come from the fantastic Creative Commons licensed <a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/">Silk Icons</a> library, created by Mark James.</p>
		        <p>Since you were probably wondering, the ScraperWiki logo is a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_tractor-scraper">wheel tractor-scraper</a>". It's like a huge cheese slice for moving soil. The logo itself was designed by <a href="http://unicorncreative.com/">James Weiner</a>.
