        <p>From helping Australian citizens <a href="http://blog.scraperwiki.com/2011/03/21/scraperwiki-ing-down-under/">keep track of planning applications</a>, to helping American lawyers <a href="https://scraperwiki.com/business/#legal">get marketing leads</a> from Government data.</p>

        <p class="platform">We have a web-based platform &ndash; or <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2012/03/09/from-cms-to-dms-c-is-for-content-d-is-for-data/">data hub</a> &ndash; where programmers write scripts to get, clean and analyse data sets. They can simply schedule code to run automatically, and they can reuse the structured data with our flexible API.</p>
        <p class="business">Meanwhile, <a href="https://scraperwiki.com/request_data/">our data request service</a> enables businesses to work with our data scientists and extract hidden value from data. They can see their data being created, control access to it, and download the resulting spreadsheets.</p>

    <h2>Company History</h2>
    <p class="first">Back in 2003, ScraperWiki&rsquo;s founders were the first people in the world to write computer programs to download Government information and make it more accessible to citizens. They created websites like <a href="http://theyworkforyou.com/">TheyWorkForYou</a>, which inspired <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/">the Sunlight Foundation</a>.</p>
    <p class="second">ScraperWiki was founded in 2009 by Julian Todd and Aidan McGuire. We received initial funding from British TV station Channel 4. After fostering an active community of open data coders and data journalists, ScraperWiki won the <a href="http://thenextweb.com/uk/2011/06/23/scraperwiki-a-uk-open-data-project-wins-280k-award/">Knight News Challenge</a> in 2011.</p>
    <p class="third last">In 2012 ScraperWiki closed a <a href="http://blog.scraperwiki.com/2012/02/09/1-million-to-build-a-data-platform-2/">million dollar round of investment</a> led by EV, to improve our platform for coders and build out our business offering.</p>
