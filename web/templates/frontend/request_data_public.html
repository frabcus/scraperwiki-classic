    <p>
        If you've found a cool dataset that you don't know how to liberate,
        post it on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/scraperwiki?hl=en">our community Google Group</a>.
        Someone might be able to give you some tips or even write the scraper for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you make your request exciting and straightforward,
        you might get more of a response. Here are some suggestions of things to include.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Why you want to liberate this data</li>
        <li>URLs or source documents</li>
        <li>Walkthrough of how you would get the data if you needed to resort to copy-and-paste, which could include</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Column names of the resulting tables</li>
            <li>Screenshots</li>
        </ul>
        <li>How often the site gets updated (if you know)</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
        If your request sounds boring or overly commercial, people probably won't respond;
        please consider our <a href="{% url request_data %}">premium services</a> if that is the case.
