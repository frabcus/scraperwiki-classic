<h2>1. Make a new view</h2>

<p>If you haven't already, please do the {% doc_link_full 'LANG_intro_tutorial' language %} first.
</p>

<p>Find the school life expectancy scraper that you made. Half way down, 
in the views section, choose "create a new view" and pick Python as your language.
</p>

<p>Put in a few lines of code, and click the "Preview" button or type Ctrl+P.
</p>

<code>print "This is a &lt;em&gt;fragment&lt;/em&gt; of HTML."
</code>

<p>If you prefer to view the output in another browser tab there is a link to "open in new window" at the top of the preview (only present after the view has been saved).</p>



<h2>2. Query the scraper's datastore</h2>

<p>Before you can read the scraper's datastore from the view, you 
need to attach to it.</p>

<code>import scraperwiki
scraperwiki.sqlite.attach("school_life_expectancy_in_years")
</code>

<p>You can attach to as many datastores as you like. Then you can access their
tables directly from queries.</p>

<code>data = scraperwiki.sqlite.select(
    "* from school_life_expectancy_in_years.swdata 
    order by years_in_school desc limit 10"
)
print data
</code>

<p>The data comes back as an array of hashes.</p>

<h2>3. Print out the results</h2>

<p>To output, you simply print to standard output.

<code>print "&lt;table&gt;"
print "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Years in school&lt;/th&gt;"
for d in data:
  print "&lt;tr&gt;"
  print "&lt;td&gt;", d["country"], "&lt;/td&gt;"
  print "&lt;td&gt;", d["years_in_school"], "&lt;/td&gt;"
  print "&lt;/tr&gt;"
print "&lt;/table&gt;"
</code>

<p>That's a simple example outputting HTML.</p>

<p>You could output a KML file, an iCal file, an RSS feed, or whatever you
need.</p>
